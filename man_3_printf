.SH NAME
_printf - formatted output conversion
.SH DEPENDENCIES
In order to use this function the user will require the following header file in its entirety:
.RE
#include <main.h>
.RE
Refer to the README.md for more installation instructions.
.SH SYNOPSIS
The _printf function writes output to stdout, the standard output stream, according to a specified format.
.SH EXHAUSTIVE DESCRIPTION
to be filled
.SH CONVERSION BY FORMAT CHARACTER
There are characters which specify which conversion will be applied. These are called format characters. Format characters are utilized upon detecting a \fB%\fR character.
The format character is required according to data type in order for the function to properly display different inputs (char, int, and string).
See examples below for proper structuring.
.sp
.SS Format character list:
.RS
.nf
c: print a single character
d: print a decimal (base 10) number
i: print an integer in base 10
s: print a string of characters
.RE
.SH EXAMPLES
To print strings and characters:
.sp
_printf("Print %c%s", 'a', "string");
.sp
To print integers and decimal numbers:
.sp
_printf("%d%i", 1337, 9000);
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, _printf returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used the end output to strings).
.sp
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

.SH BUGS
Though it is not exactly a bug, we do not stipulate an arbitrary minimum or maximum output in this code.
.sp
NOTE: due to the 32 byte system (x32) the user is still limited to the minimum and maximum integer values: -2147483648 and 2147483647.
